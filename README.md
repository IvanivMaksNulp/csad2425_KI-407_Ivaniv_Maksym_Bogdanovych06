# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Author

## Project Description
This project implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game has two main components:
- **C++ Client:** Built in Visual Studio 2022, this component acts as the client that interacts with the server to play the game.
- **Arduino R3 Server:** Running on an Arduino IDE setup, the server handles game logic and player inputs for Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core game logic and client-side code
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Main development environment for C++
- **Arduino IDE**: Development environment for Arduino R3
- **Arduino Uno R3**: Hardware component acting as the game server

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Make sure you have installed the necessary C++ development tools.
- **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE.
- **Arduino Uno R3**: Connect the Arduino board to your machine.

### Steps to Run
1. **Client Setup (C++ in Visual Studio 2022):**
   - Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2022.
   - Build and run the project.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the game.

2. **Server Setup (Arduino R3 in Arduino IDE):**
   - Open the Arduino sketch in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the sketch to the Arduino Uno R3 board.
   - The Arduino board will handle the game logic.

3. **Playing the Game:**
   - Once both client and server are running, you can start playing the game by selecting Rock, Paper, or Scissors from the client interface.

## Testing
10 simple tests were implemented to simulate real interactions and verify the correctness of the game logic.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding multiplayer support.
- Enhancing the user interface on the client side.
- Adding more test cases for edge conditions.
